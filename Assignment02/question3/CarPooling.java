//Q3. Create an application that calculates your daily driving
// cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by
// car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing
// carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion. The application
// should input the following information and display the userâ€™s
// cost per day of driving to work:
// a) Total miles driven per day.
// b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
// c) Average miles per gallon.
// d) Parking fees per day.
// e) Tolls per day.
